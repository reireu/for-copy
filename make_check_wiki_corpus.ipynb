            "francis patrick armstrong circa was steamboat captain in the east kootenay region of british columbia he also operated steamboats on the kootenay river in montana and on the stikine river in western british columbia steam navigation in the rocky mountain trench which runs through the east kootenay region was closely linked to armstrong personality and career in addition to being steamboat captain armstrong was also prospector white water boat pilot and guide in the big bend country of the columbia river early life armstrong had been born in sorel quebec about he moved to winnipeg in and then came west working with canadian pacific railway surveying crew in the columbia valley from cranbrook to golden character lewis freeman journalist adventurer movie maker and football coach came to know armstrong well in during boat trip down the columbia freeman described armstrong and as one of the most picturesque personalities in the pioneering history of british columbia beginning of steam navigation first nations possibly serving as crewman is also shown near the steamer duchess in armstrong homesteaded on the east side of columbia lake and planted potatoes with the plan of selling them to the workers building the cpr downriver at golden he built two flat bottomed boats called bateaux to transport his crop on the river armstrong decided steamboat would be good way to tow the bateaux back upstream he arranged to have steam engines shipped west from steam ferry built in that operated at his home town in quebec once the engines arrived and boiler could be located armstrong assembled steamboat from miscellaneous planks and timbers that were lying around at an old sawmill the result was the duchess launched in at golden two early passengers wrote that her appearance was somewhat decrepit and armstrong himself later agreed that she was pretty crude steamboat building the second duchess duchess at golden bc ca duchess sank at least once but armstrong was eventually able to raise her from the river he then applied the odd shaped steamer to make enough money in to have new sternwheeler built also called duchess armstrong hired the veteran shipbuilder alexander watson of victoria bc to build the new steamer which although small was well designed and looked like steamboat armstrong also had built second steamer marion which although smaller than the second duchess needed only six inches of water to run in this was an advantage in the often shallow waters of the columbia above golden where as armstrong put it the river bottom was often very close to the river top the baillie grohman canal completed lock at the baillie grohman canal ca armstrong deliberately destroyed these lock gates in making the transit of north star through the canal in curious feature of the rocky mountain trench is that two of the major rivers that flow through it the columbia flowing north and the kootenay flowing south are separated by only about mile of low marshy prairie at place now known as canal flats as the name implies shipping canal was built across canal flats by william adolf baillie grohman european adventurer and promoter from wealthy and privileged background the canal was completed in but it was only used three times by steamboats every time under the command of captain armstrong in armstrong built gwendoline at hansen landing on the kootenay river and took the vessel through the canal north to the shipyard at golden to complete her fitting out by this time it appears that the canal had been damaged or deteriorated to the boat where at least some of the transit of gwendoline had to be accomplished by pulling the vessel of the water partially dismantling the boat and pulling her along on rollers over the winter armstrong it is reported was able to prevail on the provincial government to expend funds to repair the canal in late may armstrong returned the completed gwendoline back to the kootenay river this time transiting normally the rehabilitated canal the canal remained unused until when armstrong brought north star north from the kootenay to the columbia the transit of north star was only made possible by the destruction by dynamite of the lock at the canal mining boom on the upper kootenay river mining boom along the upper kootenay river in the early led to demand for shipping to transport miners and supplies into and ore out of the region surrounding the river the great northern railway at jennings montana was the nearest downriver railhead for upper kootenay shipping armstrong moved south from the columbia to the kootenay and built the small sternwheeler gwendoline at hansen landing about north of the present community of wasa instead of taking the ore south to the jennings armstrong plan was to move the ore north across canal flats and then down the columbia to the cpr railhead at golden armstrong took gwendoline through the baillie grohman canal in the fall of or rolled her across canal flats fitted her out at golden and returned through the canal in the spring of the difficulty of moving gwendoline through the canal convinced armstrong that the only feasible route was south to jennings by early armstrong joined with veteran willamette river steamboat captain james miller and built ruth named after armstrong daughter at libby montana ruth was the largest steamer yet to operate on the upper kootenay river later armstrong and miller associated with wardner and when their competitors depuy and jones suffered the misfortune of having their new vessel rustler tons sunk after just six weeks of operation the three men were able to dominate the river traffic jennings canyon north star ca this was the largest vessel ever to operate on the columbia river above golden bc once in the united states the kootenay river in its natural state before the construction of the libby dam flowed through jennings canyon to the settlement of jennings montana jennings has almost completely disappeared as town but it was near libby montana above jennings the kootenay river narrowed as it ran through jennings canyon which was significant hazard to any river navigation particularly dangerous stretch was known as the elbow jennings canyon was described by professor lyman as strip of water foaming white downhill almost as on steep roof hardly wider than steamboat no insurance agent would write policy for steamboats and cargo transiting the jennings canyon armstrong once persuaded an agent from san francisco to consider making quote on premiums the agent decided to examine the route for himself and went on board with armstrong as the captain boat shot through the canyon at the end of the trip the agent quote for policy was one quarter of the value of the cargo faced with this quote armstrong decided to forgo insurance the huge profits to be made seemed to justify the risk combined the two steamers could earn in gross receipts per day lot of money in by comparison the sternwheeler farrell cost to build in in ten days of operation then an entire steamboat could be paid for armstrong and miller unsuccessfully tried to get the government to finance clearing of some of the rocks and obstructions in jennings canyon without government help they hired crews themselves to do the work over two winters but the results were not of much value despite the work on the channel every steamboat armstrong ever took through jennings canyon was eventually wrecked in the canyon the wreck gwendoline and ruth on may resulted in the destruction of ruth and the sinking of gwendoline fortunately with no losses other than severe financial ones when the new steamer north star was launched few weeks later armstrong was able to make up for some of the losses with completed round trips on the kootenay between fort steele and jennings before low water forced him to tie up on september move to the stikine river mono with damaged paddlewheel possibly at wrangel alaska frank armstrong and henderson built this vessel which was initially intended for service on the stikine river in january armstrong went north to alaska to participate in the klondike gold rush with armstrong deciding to try his chances at making money as steamboat captain on the stikine river then being promoted as the all canadian route to the yukon river gold fields on the stikine river armstrong served with the famous steamboat captain john irving together with henderson armstrong built steamboat mono for the teslin transportation company of victoria bc as might be expected from vessel designed by armstrong mono had excellent shallow water performance when the stikine river route collapsed as an alternate access to the klondike in july mono was taken under tow to st michael alaska for service on the yukon river return to the columbia river north star was sold back to captain armstrong when he returned from his klondike adventure and on june he took her north to the columbia river on his famous dynamite aided transit of the decrepit baillie grohman canal with north star gone steamboating on the upper kootenay ended for good while armstrong had been engaged in the kootenay and the klondike mining booms few competitors had appeared on the upper columbia in harold forster wealthy mountain climber businessman politician and occasional steamboat captain brought selkirk by rail from shuswap lake to golden where he launched her but used her as yacht and not at least initially as commercial vessel also captain alexander blakely bought the little sidewheeler pert and operated her on the river in armstrong dismantled duchess armstrong built new steamer ptarmigan using the engines from duchess which were by then were over years old service in the great war many men from british columbia served in world war which began in steamboat men were no exception even armstrong although he could easily have stayed home because of his age instead armstrong supervised british river transport in the middle east on the nile and tigris rivers the tigris in particular was in difficult and hard fought theater of war armstrong was not the only one of the small community of steamboat men of golden to serve armstrong apprentice john blakely the son of his former competitor enlisted and went to europe where he became one of only six survivors when his ship was torpedoed in the english channel end of steam navigation on the upper columbia river abandoned sternwheelers at boatyard at golden bc larger steamer is probably selkirk with apparently smaller vessel unidentified behind ca the construction of railroads and the economic dislocations caused by the war had doomed steamboats as method of transportation on the upper columbia with armstrong in command nowitka made the last steamboat run on the upper columbia in may pushing barge mounted pile driver to build bridge at brisco which when complete was too low to allow steamboat to pass under it last years and legacy armstrong found employment with the dominion government on his return from the war he was seriously injured in an accident in nelson bc and died in an hospital in vancouver bc in january his own life had spanned the entire history of steam navigation in the rocky mountain trench from to an older riverman who had known captain armstrong said of him with

first french empire and several foreign auxiliaries including polish insurgents of france besieged the prussian fortified town of kolberg the only remaining prussian held fortress in the prussian province of pomerania the siege was not successful and was lifted upon the announcement of the peace of tilsit after prussia lost the battle of jena auerstedt in late french troops marched north into prussian pomerania fortified stettin szczecin surrendered without battle and the province became occupied by the french forces kolberg resisted and the implementation of french siege was delayed until march by the freikorps of ferdinand von schill operating around the fortress and capturing the assigned french commander of the siege victor perrin during these months the military commander of kolberg lucadou and the representative of the local populace nettelbeck prepared the fortress defensive structures the french forces commanded by teulié composed primarily of troops from italy succeeded in encircling kolberg by mid march napoleon put the siege force under the command of loison frederick william iii entrusted gneisenau with the defense in early april the siege forces were for short time commanded by mortier who had marched large force from besieged swedish stralsund to kolberg but was ordered to return when stralsund defenders gained ground other reinforcements came from states of the confederation of the rhine kingdom of württemberg saxon duchies and the duchy of nassau the kingdom of holland and france with the western surroundings of kolberg flooded by the defenders fighting concentrated on the eastern forefield of the fortress where wolfsberg sconce had been constructed on lucadou behalf aiding the defense from the nearby baltic sea were british and swedish vessel by late june napoleon massively reinforced the siege forces to bring about decision the siege force then also concentrated on taking the port north of the town on july fighting ceased when prussia had agreed on an unfavourable peace after her ally russia suffered decisive defeat at friedland of the twenty prussian fortresses kolberg was one of the few remaining in prussian hands until the war end the battle became myth in prussia and was later used by nazi propaganda efforts while prior to world war ii the city commemorated the defendants it started to honor the commander of the polish troops after when the city became part of polish state prelude within two weeks after the battle of jena auerstedt october napoleon grande armée had pursued the defeated royal prussian army to pasewalk in prussian pomerania the provincial capital stettin now szczecin one of twenty prussian fortresses capitulated on october the province only fortress remaining in prussian hands pierre thouvenout was appointed french governor of pomerania and sent his envoy mestram to accept kolberg expected capitulation and take control of it on november mestram met with the prussian commander of kolberg louis maurice de lucadou ludwig moritz von lucadou before its walls lucadou refusal to hand over the fortress came as surprise to the french generals and the prussian administration in stettin who had already pledged allegiance to the french it further led part of the defeated prussian army to take refuge in kolberg and reinforce the two musketeer battalions of the von owstien and von borcke regiments and the guns garrisoned there lucadou ordered the persante parseta river west of kolberg to be dammed up to flood the area around the fortress and arranged the construction of wolfsberg sconce east of the town coordination of these measures with joachim nettelbeck representative of the kolberg citizens was however impaired by the latter personal grievances against lucadou among the prussian soldiers who had retreated to kolberg after jena and auerstedt was ferdinand von schill who after his recovery from severe head injury in the house of kolberg senator westphal was ordered to patrol the areas west of the fortress with small cavalry unit supplied with information about french movements by local peasants he succeeded in capturing number of french officers and soldiers gathering food and financial supplies in neighboring towns and villages and recruiting volunteers to his unit from inside and outside kolberg schill victory in the skirmish of gülzow december though insignificant from military point of view was widely noted as the first prussian success against the french army while prussian king frederick william iii praised schill as the kind of man now valued by the fatherland napoleon referred to him as miserable kind of brigand ce miserable qui est une espèce de brigand as consequence of these successes and schill increasing fame prussian king frederick william iii ordered him to establish freikorps on january which in the following months defended the fortress against french attacks allowing its defenders to complete their preparations for the expected siege with swedish and british support via the baltic time for preparation was needed since kolberg lacked sufficient defensive structures manpower and armament to withstand siege the defensive works of the fortress had been neglected only the port and kirchhof sconce had been prepared for defense when prussia feared war with russia and sweden in and but they had been disarmed in september by early december the kolberg garrison numbered men but increased steadily during the next months due to the arrival of prussian troops and new recruits from nearby areas armament shortages were in part relieved by charles xiii of sweden who sent rifle components from which local gunsmiths made new rifles as of late october total of guns were mounted on kolberg walls metal iron cannons lb lb lb lb six iron howitzers lb and eight iron mortars lb lb in addition there were four mobile pounder cannons while convoy with artillery reinforcements was held up and captured by french forces near stettin twelve pounder cannons reached kolberg from the prussian fortress of danzig and the swedish fortress of stralsund who each sent six guns since no further artillery reinforcements came in the kolberg garrison mounted an additional guns on the walls which previously had been deemed unusable and withdrawn from service these guns were positioned at the flanks at it was speculated that they might still serve to fire rocks and canister shots at short distances six guns captured by schill freikorps were also sent to kolberg claude victor perrin whom napoleon bonaparte had entrusted with taking kolberg was captured by schill forces in arnswalde january detained in kolberg and later exchanged against prussian general gebhard leberecht von blücher with victor perrin captured the attack on kolberg was to be led by pietro pierre teulié italian division who in february began the march on the fortress from stettin schill freikorps further delayed the french advance by provoking several skirmishes and battles the largest of which took place near naugard nowogard teulié reached the kolberg area by early march and by the mid of the month march had cleared the surrounding villages of schill forces and encircled the fortress siege mid march to april when the french encirclement of kolberg rendered schill strategy moot lucadou sent three cavalry units to aid the krockow freikorps in the defense of danzig while schill departed to aid in the defense of stralsund in swedish pomerania the suburbs most notably were burned down as it was customary because of the delay in the french advance napoleon replaced teulié as the commander of the siege forces with division general louis henri loison frederick william iii replaced lucadou as the commander of the fortress with major august neidhardt von gneisenau after complaints by nettelbeck and out of considerations for an envisioned british landfall at kolberg he feared that french born commander might irritate his british supporters while on the other hand gneisenau had been in british service during the american revolutionary war in april napoleon withdrew the forces of edouard mortier from the siege of stralsund and sent them to take kolberg however mortier soon had to return when the defenders of stralsund pushed the remaining french troops out of swedish pomerania the french siege army was reinforced by troops from württemberg and saxon states saxe coburg saalfeld saxe gotha altenburg saxe meiningen saxe hildburghausen and saxe weimar as well as polish regiment the saxon and württemberg

rule in early november marshal davout seized poznan and soon dabrowski entered the city he ordered conscription and assembled an army of men on january napoleon triumphantly entered warsaw aware of the enormous power of the polish nobility napoleon intended to acquire its support rather than rely solely on the masses indeed rallying the polish nobility around his rule was major characteristic of

determination in the attacks on wolfsberg sconce plan of the siege purple french trenches dark areas around kolberg flooded and rubble of burned suburbs on may an arms replenishment for the defenders arrived by sea from great britain containing inter alia rifles sabres and ammunition some of those supplies including rifles were however redirected to the defenders of stralsund on may napoleon

with guns and supported the defenders from the sea pounder gun was mounted on each of these boats which had been prepared by nettelbeck later fourth boat was similarly prepared by lieutenant fabe on june during the evening the supporting ships directed artillery fire on the polish camp which proved to be ineffective due to strong winds three hours later an armed expedition of estimated prussians attempted to land on the beach and was repulsed in intense fighting by the polish regiment on june british artillery replenishments arrived for the defenders including iron cannons iron howitzers and ammunition the guns replaced the many unusable guns on kolberg walls since the fortress had experienced shortage of light artillery while at the same time it had sufficient cannonball supplies in

the announcement of the prusso french agreement to the peace of tilsit prusso french truce had been signed already on june following the decisive russian defeat in the battle of friedland kolberg was one of the few prussian fortresses which withstood napoleon forces until the peace was signed others were glatz kłodzko and graudenz grudziądz casualties based on data from the prussian military archive höpfner lists the casualties for the prussian garrison of kolberg saying it is uncertain whether they included the losses of the schill freikorps as follows officers corporals privates killed in action lethally wounded wounded captured missing deserted discharged as invalids total höpfner further reports that schill freikorps lost total of infantry artillerists and an unrecorded number of cavalry and jäger as dead wounded captured or missing of the civilian population of kolberg died and were wounded primarily during the two final days regarding the casualties of the siege force höpfner says that the prussian archives reports list total of to dead and wounded of whom were killed and injured during the last two days höpfner does not cite the number claimed by the french which he dismissed as worthless and says that the beforementioned prussian claim for the total siege force casualties might be exaggerated the casualty figures cited by smith in the greenhill napoleonic wars data book match höpfner numbers for the prussian garrison as they were used as source for the siege force casualties smith lists officers and men dead and wounded or died of sickness aftermath

adbhutananda was the first monastic disciple to come to ramakrishna while most of ramakrishna direct disciples came from the bengali intelligentsia adbhutananda lack of formal education made him unique amongst them he was servant boy of devotee of ramakrishna and he later became his monastic disciple though unlettered adbhutananda was considered as monk with great spiritual insight by ramakrishna followers and vivekananda regarded him as the greatest miracle of ramakrishna biography early life adbhutananda was born in north eastern india in the chhapra district of bihar around the middle of the nineteenth century he was given the name rakhturam meaning child who is protected by lord rama his parents were poor humble villagers both his father and mother died before rakhturam was five years old and he was left in the care of an uncle who was affectionate towards him growing up in the village rakhturam led carefree life tending cows and sheep in the fields in later years he said used to wander freely with the cowherd boys how simple and guileless they were you can have real joy unless you are like that poverty forced rakhturam and his uncle to travel to calcutta in search of livelihood rakhturam came in contact with ramachandra datta householder devotee of ramakrishna and he joined as his servant as servant rakhturam was considered energetic and faithful rakhturam became known as latu in his new calcutta surroundings and he was called by that name thereafter meetings with ramakrishna ramakrishna lived at the dakshineswar kāli temple few miles north of calcutta on the eastern bank of the ganges ram chandra datta latu employer was one of the first householder disciples to visit ramakrishna datta loved to speak about ramakrishna and his sayings and latu heard about ramakrishna from him and was attracted by ramakrishna teachings it is reported that inspired by the teachings of ramakrishna he was often found lying covered with his blanket quietly wiping tears from his eyes thinking of god latu waited eagerly for an opportunity to meet ramakrishna and he met ramakrishna on sunday in or when ramakrishna saw latu he reportedly said to ramchandra that latu had holy signs in him and it is reported that when ramakrishna touched him latu entered an ecstatic state tears trickled from his eyes and his lips began to quiver with emotion and he gradually returned to normal state of consciousness latu began to visit ramakrishna regularly and he lost the enthusiasm with which he worked before at datta house in june he joined ramakrishna at dakshineswar as his personal attendant and helper he also used to help sarada devi in her chores with ramakrishna in dakshineswar at dakshineswar latu began life of rigorous spiritual discipline under ramakrishna guidance and also continued his service as his servant to him his day began first seeing ramakrishna and saluting him as latu had received no formal schooling ramakrishna hoped that he might acquire at least rudimentary education so he tried to teach him the bengali alphabets himself however latu bihari accent was different from that of bengali and he could not read even the first vowel correctly ramakrishna corrected him repeatedly with much amusement and the experiment was later discontinued according to saradananda ramakrishna monastic disciple latu was seen praying and meditating the whole night and sleeping during the day his life was literal example of the teaching of the gita in that which is night to all beings the man of self control is awake and where all beings are awake there is night for the sage who sees at shyampukur and cossipore in the middle of ramakrishna throat became sore which later developed into throat cancer to conveniently treat him the devotees moved ramakrishna from dakshineswar to shyampukur in north calcutta latu being his personal attendant went with him he later moved on with ramakrishna to cossipore on december he took care of nursing ramakrishna during his final days reminiscing about which latu said serving the master was our worship we didn need any other spiritual disciplines latu received an ochre cloth and rosary from ramakrishna after ramakrishna death on august latu went on pilgrimage visiting vrindaban varanasi ayodhya with sarada devi and other lay and monastic disciples of ramakrishna at calcutta adbhutananda with girish chandra ghosh mahendranath gupta and other disciples and devotees of ramakrishna after ramakrishna passing away narendra vivekananda and some of the other disciples established the first ramakrishna monastery at baranagore in an old dilapidated house here some of the disciples including naren took their monastic vows and were engaged in the study of the scriptures practicing meditation and austerity latu joined them later in and accepted the monastic vows vivekananda gave him the monastic name adbhutananda meaning he who finds bliss in the wonderful nature of the atman according to his brother monks adbhutananda lead very austere life at the monastery practicing meditation and japa he led the life of wandering monk around calcutta area unattached to people and places sometimes he stayed at the home of other householder devotees but most often was found living simply on the bank of the ganges sometimes he stayed at alambazar math and belur math he also went on several pilgrimages to north india with his brother disciples including vivekananda in he moved to the house of balaram bose householder devotee of ramakrishna and stayed there till here he was visited by people from different walks of life judges doctors teachers learned monks and householders for spiritual instructions at varanasi in october adbhutananda left balaram hose for varnasi never to return again here he first stayed at ramakrishna advaita ashrama and later at different locations as was characteristic of him he was so often absorbed in meditation that he rarely had fixed time for meals in varanasi he continued to teach and people visited him for spiritual instructions last days during his last days according to his devotees adbhutananda seemed to be gradually withdrawing from the world he spoke occasionally with people and when he spoke it was generally of spiritual matters as reported by this disciples his body which had once been remarkably strong had been gradually weakened by age and years of intense spiritual disciplines and his indifference towards the physical world during the last few years he suffered from diabetes and minor physical ailments during the last year of his life he developed blister on this leg which developed into gangrene he was visited by his brother disciples turiyananda and saradananda eventually the gangrene worsened and the doctors operated several times on successive days but were unsuccessful adbhutananda died in the holy city of varanasi at on saturday april regarding his death turiyananda wrote in letter to josephine macleod an american devotee of vivekananda he showed no signs of pain during his illness but the wonder of all wonders was that after this death when his body was placed in sitting position to conform with some of the funeral rites we found him looking so beautiful so serene so full of peace and bliss his face beamed with light and an intelligence unspeakable as if he were taking leave from his friends for the last time with an exhortation of affectionate benediction teachings and sayings adbhutananda being illiterate did not write any books his teachings and discourses have been recorded by his disciples and devotees swami adbhutananda taught that the true being in man is ever free ever pure and remains ever untouched by good or evil good and evil have no absolute reality they exist only so long as man identifies himself with the ego the false self when the ego is completely annihilated man is freed from the false knowledge of duality or relativity of good and evil his other teachings were what is the use of prayer and meditation if there is no dependence on him everything else is useless if this is lacking it is great sin to find fault with others those who do never do good act themselves who easily see defects in others and energetically spread rumors it is better to continue calling on the lord devotedly than to know speak and preach thousand and one religious cants and

departementet for udenrigske sager handel sjøfart og industri one of his main areas of interest during this period was the dissolution of the norwegian union with sweden the public discussion in norway concerned whether or not the dissolution of the union was in line with norwegian constitutional law despite his position as civil servant erik publicly criticised the union as matter of constitutional law and instead he claimed that the dissolution had been in violation of international law and was later asked by fridtjof nansen to write an account of the issue in he went on to pursue an academic career and went to paris on scholarship upon his arrival in france he was quickly asked to serve at the norwegian consulate in le havre where he moved in he returned to oslo in the

europe he traveled back and forth to london where he met with sir cyril william hurcomb and negotiated payment for the ships that norway provided for allied forces during the war he was also very focused on norway contribution to foreign affairs in general director of the league of nation minorities section px origins of the minorities section colban was fundamental in the development of the league of nations minorities section as consequence of the treaties of the paris peace conference the league of nations found itself responsible for monitoring and defending minority groups across europe the irregularity of the league council meetings and sense of minority issues being of minor importance made these issues increasingly treated by the secretariat itself at the founding of the league of nations in the role of the league secretariat had been envisioned as purely advisory and administrative collection of experts aiding the workings of the council delegate however the administrative personnel of the secretariat would increasingly have to redefine their own roles and in the system erik colban who became the director of the minorities section of the league of nations and it spiritual father in found himself to be member of an entirely new class of international bureaucrats thus colban proved to be an instrumental figure in creating and developing the policy on minorities he created system which was surprisingly able to keep myriad minority problems from tearing europe apart far sooner development of the minorities section through personal interaction and administrative mastery colban helped to protect and develop the minorities system as the league council initially distanced itself from the responsibility of dealing with minority issues it gave colban the liberty to further develop the petition system as seen below the minorities section attempted to develop practical translation of the unworkable terms of article of the league of nations thus colban created process where minority violations could be addressed through quiet and secret channels colban established formal procedure for receiving and distributing minority petitions committee of three system whereby every petition deemed receivable by the secretariat was examined by an ad hoc group of council members the acting president two selected governments to determine whether treaty violation had occurred and if it should or should not be reported to the council the initial system had thrown the minority petitions onto public stage with little action taken due to intense public scrutiny colban personal interaction with major governmental figures of minority states was an important instrument to the success of the minorities section by the end of colban and members of the section had travelled to belgrade sofia bucharest transylvania athens bulgaria budapest vienna and prague multiple times and colban personally spent around six months each year abroad furthermore colban ensured that his minorities section undertook an increasing responsibility for the examination and action upon these petitions specifically the minorities section employed detailed evaluation of the receivability of petitions colban and the section became instrumental in the formation of and action regarding these petitions he and his staff became the gatekeeper of the petitions challenges to the system from within the league conflicts between the minorities section and the minority states eventually proved inevitable complaints from the minority states poland and czechoslovakia about floods of propagandistic petitions and accusations of the committees multiplying minority complaints led to challenge from several minority states within the league in the challenging states attempted to wreck colban system of committee of three by means of obstruction and proposals for reform to avoid endangering league authority colban and the secretariat skilfully recalibrated the systems in september the council adopted series of resolutions tightening the rules of receivability of petitions granting generous extensions to accused governments to prepare their observations and restricting the distribution of all materials to council members alone being beneficial development for minority states and the great powers putting less pressure in minority states and thus easing tensions in the league but decremental development for the minorities themselves this is an example of the lengths to which colban was willing to go in order to preserve the system in spite of an inherent sympathy towards minorities colban proved to be pragmatist by necessity balancing concerns of the minorities with concerns over european peace required skilful political acrobatics minority activists critique of the system as colban and the league system was bound by the principle of state sovereignty they not only guarded the minority states interests and dismissed all but the most politically explosive complaints they also blocked outside improvement proposals this approach was severely criticised by minority activists such as professor gilbert murray an oxford classicist both for its favouring the interests of the minority states over those of the minorities and for the secrecy involved in dealing with petitions leading to suspicions of them disappearing in the swollen bureaucracy colban who defined his task as transforming million individuals into loyal citizens was unmoved by this criticism the effect of germany upon the minorities section on october germany supported financially the organization of european minorities congress the leaders of the minority groups from eastern europe met in geneva colban did not want that this gathering changed the functioning of the minority section of the league by reform proposals as consequence he reinforced the publicity about their achievements james eric drummond the secretary general of the league and colban found another way of representing the minorities section which excluded states minorities and neighbouring states to participate in the decision making that could concern them in one way or the other this was compromise in order to gain support from the neighbouring states of germany and the german government and was advised by colban when germany received its permanent seat at the council in colban started tutoring stresemann on how to attend to minority affairs he even succeeded in convincing the german delegates to wait year before participating in the minorities section until they understood the situation completely this manoeuvre kept germany from presenting any questions regarding minorities to the general assembly until working with the germans colban managed to convince them that theleague system of secret compromise was effective and desirable no changes were made in the section while colban was in office it was only in regards to the petitioners that changes were made but the changes of the internal structure could not gain approval when changes to the minorities section were laid for the general assembly later on chamberlain opposed the changes and argued it worked properly during colban leadership late career in his late career colban held several important positions working both as an international bureaucrat and as representative for the norwegian government from to colban worked as the director of the disarmament section of the league disarmament being colban though among the most crucial issues in order to secure peace on this issue colban faced increasing resistance from the great powers in particular britain and france px in colban returned to the foreign service as envoy to paris and brussels and luxembourg he remained in touch however with the league of nation environment and became the norwegian delegate to the disarmament conference and to the league annual sessions moreover he was actively engaged in the manchuria conflict colban left the league of nations in when he was appointed as envoy to london ambassador from erik colban now an experienced diplomat belonged to the traditional school of diplomats used to act only on instruction from the government following the german invasion of norway april colban was cut off from communication with the government not receiving instructions colban was accused of inaction especially in relation to orders to the merchant fleet later colban would be involved in setting up the norwegian shipping and trade mission nortraship crucial contribution to the allied war effort the norwegian exile government had much use of colban language skills and diplomatic know how in colban headed the committee drafting the norwegian british military agreement and it was not least thanks to his efforts that norway reached very favourable settlement with britain in towards the end of the war colban influenced the norwegian government decision to support united nations dominated by the great powers and he was appointed the norwegian delegate to the un first general assembly in in he became member of the united nation war crimes commission and the inter allied committee that set up the international court of justice in the hague after his retirement as ambassador in colban was still part of diplomatic life from he was chairman of the norwegian delegation for the preparation of broad international un conference on trade and administration he was also the norwegian delegate to the havana conference during as final point in his career from to colban became the personal representative for the un secretary general trygve lie in the negotiations between india and pakistan concerning kashmir in colban published his autobiography fifty years femti aar the question of individual rights vs state rights after the second world war the question about international law and national sovereignty was broadly discussed issue the founding of the united nations brought different approach to the question of human rights the focus of the league of nations was commitment to collective rights of the states themselves and now the postwar approach was centered on individual human rights however minority protection was regarded as weak and obscure as member of the un colban was opposed the idea of european superstate and to strong interference into national issues this was due to the problems he experienced arising from the interference of the league of nations into minority politics in eastern europe during the interwar period acknowledgement of the sovereignty of the nation states was key concern of the un and this was point in its charts which was not to be changed in order to secure peace it was absolutely imperative to avoid repeating the mistakes of the league of nations the un as tool for peace for colban the primary aim of the un as well as of the league of nations was keeping the peace unlike the league of nations it was to be permanent organization but also world organization in order to be able to preserve peace he saw the reason for the failure of the league of nations in the fact that important nation states were not members in order to be able to do better the un was to include all states willing to participate and work against the possibility of countries of resigning this opinion of colban was also to be understood against the background of the cold war he sensed that if the un was not able to keep the soviet union as member this would endanger peace he even proposed if the statutes of the un was to be updated member resignation should be made impossible at the same time he was contemplating weakening the veto with which ussr was making things difficult he thought that the specialized agencies of the un were very important part of the organisation their work indirect but indispensable for world peace reflections on international institutions in when colban was retired he wrote an article titled the united nation as permanent world organisation where he reflected on the un and league of nations in the article he gave his thought on whether or not the un would survive or if it would fail like its predecessor had he especially focused on what had been done wrong in the league of nations and what as consequence had been changed in the un charters one of his main statements was that the tasks of the un should be both political and non political meaning that it should secure peace but at the same time working towards solving economic social cultural and humanitarian issues another very important element he mentions that should secure the survival of the un was that every nation was member and that it should not be allowed to withdraw ones membership which was not the case with the league of nations he quotes spanish official in saying that it would be impossible to imagine world without an institution such as the un references bibliography\n",

            "title page of eikonoklastes eikonoklastes from the greek εἰκονοκλάστης iconoclast is book by john milton published october in it he provides justification for the execution of charles which had taken place on january the book title is taken from the greek and means iconoclast or breaker of the icon and refers to eikon basilike royalist propaganda work the translation of eikon basilike is icon of the king it was published immediately after the execution milton book is therefore usually seen as parliamentarian propaganda explicitly designed to counter the royalist arguments background milton was commissioned to write eikonoklastes as response to charles supposed eikon basilike the tract was intended to be the official argument by the commonwealth government eikon basilike was published just after charles execution and the work portrayed him as martyr the piece was written with straightforward political aims to stir up popular sentiment in support of the former monarch and to undermine the control of the commonwealth government the work proved so popular that there were editions produced that year milton approach was different from that of eikon basilike which may have in fact been composite work with john gauden involved in ghostwriting instead of appealing to popular sentiment milton work was closely argued and tried to meet each of the points in the eikon milton believed certainly that the eikon basilike created false idol and he wanted to destroy it with truth eikonoklastes titled eikonolastes in answer to book intitl eikon basilike the portrature of his sacred majesty in his solitudes and sufferings was issued in two versions in october in english and was enlarged in it was quite soon translated into latin and french in reply appeared eikon aklastos the icon unbroken it was written by joseph jane involved in royalist organisation tract milton begins his work by mentioning that he was commissioned to write eikonoklastes and that he did such for the good of the commonwealth take it on me as work assign rather then by me cho or affected the central argument of eikonoklastes involves the tyranny inherent in all monarchies and milton attacks the idea put forth by charles that the liberty of individuals consists in the enjoyment of the fruits of our industry and the benefit of those laws to which we our selves have consented milton response is to point out how such definition cannot actually separate different kinds of governments first for in the injoyment of those fruits which our industry and labours have made our own upon our own what privilege is that above what the turks jewes and mores enjoy under the turkish monarchy for without that kind of justice which is also in argiers among theevs and pirates between themselves no kind of government no societie just or unjust could stand no combination or conspiracy could stick together we expect therfore something more that must distinguish free government from slavish to milton charles was able to coerce the english people and actually made them his slaves especially through his veto power which established him as the transcendent and ultimat law above all our laws and to rule us forcibly by laws to which we ourselves did not consent milton attacks charles rhetorical flourishes throughout eikon basilike and he claims that the whole book might perhaps be intended peece of poetrie milton criticises every aspect of eikon basilike to the point that when charles claims that he was with gentlemen milton responds gentlemen indeed the ragged infantrie of stewes and brothels however the criticism was not limited to just style and images in response to charles coining the term demagogue milton claims that the word is an attack on the english language and the english people the affrightment of this goblin word for the king by his leave cannot coine english as he could money to be current in the second edition milton expanded his claim that the supporters of charles were an inconstant irrational and image doting rabble to declare that like credulous and hapless herd begott to servility and inchanted with these popular institutes of tyranny subscrib with new device of the kings picture at his praiers hold out both thir eares with such delight and ravishment to be stigmatiz and board through in witness of thir own voluntary and beloved baseness milton also altered an epigraph by sallust on the title page that comes from gaius memmius speech in bellum iugurthinum the speech penned by sallust for memmius describes various abuses and is used to argue that all monarchs are corrupt in addition to discussion of charles and monarchy milton adds response to edward hyde st earl of clarendon who wrote the history of the rebellion and civil wars themes milton argues that in all monarchical governments there is potential for enslaving the population which was an argument he previously relied on in his the tenure of kings and magistrates milton view of freedom was not limited to just having the right to property but to be free from the potential of arbitrary domination by monarch monarchy was not the only subject of importance to milton within eikonoklastes milton also defended calvinistic principles and he claims that reformation cannot accept episcopal or monarchical control instead presbyterian based religion was the only proper type of religion to john shawcross milton experience while writing the piece along with the two defences supplied the experience with the world that dark world and wide that seems to have been needed for milton to move beyond the defiant to degrees of understanding if not acceptance of humankind starting in milton began to connect his various prose publications with the plan of future epic to be composed and eikonoklastes was one such work as such there are multiple parallels between the actions of charles monarchy and satan rule in hell found within paradise lost the description of rise of an antichristian monarchs near the end of eikonoklastes declares that such individuals rely on an ambiguous language to gain power likewise milton satan relies on the same kind of rhetoric likewise the deviant followers of charles are connected to demons in hell who drink and blaspheme critical review the work failed it is the general view that milton work did not succeed at least in terms of rebutting the eikon basilike on the other hand scholars still debate exactly what the polemic intention of milton work was this book was the first work by milton to be at all widely read public sentiment still supported charles but the tract was able to appeal to larger audience than many of milton previous works after the english restoration of milton and other republicans faced vindictive new government and eikonoklastes was said to have justified regicides the act of oblivion was enacted on august and milton was not among those who were listed to suffer the death penalty for their part in charles execution on the other hand proclamation by the king demanded that eikonoklastes and defensio pro populo anglicano be burned the works were soon after burned in public by the public hangman this did not stop the work attracting readers and there was new edition in after the glorious revolution notes references corns thomas milton prose in

            "the decision of the parliament of scotland to ratify the treaty of union in was not unanimous and from that time individuals and organisations have advocated the reinstatement of scottish parliament some have argued for devolution scottish parliament within the united kingdom while others have advocated complete independence the people of scotland first got the opportunity to vote in referendum on proposals for devolution in and although majority of those voting voted yes the referendum legislation also required of the electorate to vote yes for the plans to be enacted and this was not achieved second referendum opportunity in this time on strong proposal resulted in an overwhelming yes victory leading to the scotland act being passed and the scottish parliament being established in scottish voters were given the chance to vote yes on outright independence in referendum in an effort to persuade scots to remain in the union the major uk parties vowed to devolve further powers to scotland after the referendum the no vote prevailed independence was rejected and the campaign promise of devolution resulted in the formation of the smith commission and the eventual passage of the scotland act to having agreed to pass the union with england act the parliament of scotland adjourned on march the new united kingdom of great britain came into being on may with single parliament of great britain which in effect was the parliament of england with the addition of scottish representation the post of secretary of state for scotland existed after until the jacobite rising of thereafter responsibility for scotland lay primarily with the office of the secretary of state for the northern department usually exercised by the lord advocate the secretaries of state were reorganised in and the duties now came under the secretary of state for the home department administrative devolution saw the creation of the scottish office and the post of secretary for scotland from the secretary for scotland sat in cabinet but the position was not officially recognised as full member of the cabinet of the united kingdom until the secretary for scotland post was upgraded to full secretary of state rank as secretary of state for scotland in government of scotland bill in may the house of commons passed the second reading of the government of scotland bill also referred to as the scottish home rule bill by votes to the bill was supported by liberals and opposed by unionists it did not proceed further due to the outbreak of the first world war scottish covenant association and the scottish covenant association was non partisan political organisation that sought the establishment of devolved scottish assembly it was formed by john maccormick who had left the scottish national party in when they decided to support all out independence for scotland rather than devolution as had been their position the association was responsible for the creation of the scottish covenant which gathered two million signatures in support of devolution members of the organisation were also responsible for the removal of the stone of destiny from westminster abbey in that attracted huge publicity for the cause of scottish home rule kilbrandon report devolution referendum the scottish referendum of was post legislative referendum to decide whether there was sufficient support for the scotland act that was to create deliberative assembly for scotland the act required that for the act not to be repealed at least of the electorate would have to vote yes in the referendum the referendum resulted in narrow yes majority but fell short of the requirement devolution referendum the scottish devolution referendum of was pre legislative referendum over whether there was support for the creation of scottish parliament within the united kingdom and whether there was support for such parliament to have tax varying powers in response to the clear majority voting for both proposals the united kingdom parliament passed the scotland act creating the scottish parliament and scottish executive the scotland act the act was introduced by the labour government in after the referendum it created the scottish parliament setting out how members of the scottish parliament are to be elected making some provision about the internal operation of the parliament although many issues are left for the parliament itself to regulate and setting out the process for the parliament to consider and pass bills which become acts of the scottish parliament once they receive royal assent the act specifically asserts the continued power of the uk parliament to legislate in respect of scotland the act devolves all powers except over matter it specifies as reserved matters it further designates list of statutes which are not amenable to amendment or repeal by the parliament which includes the human rights act and many provisions of the scotland act itself even when acting within its legislative competence the act further constrains the powers of the parliament by inhibiting it from acting in manner incompatible with the european convention on human rights or european community law the same constraints apply to acts of the scottish executive scottish parliament established may the new scottish parliament building at holyrood designed by the spanish architect enric miralles and opened in october the scottish parliament met for the first time on may and began its first session with snp member winnie ewing stating the scottish parliament adjourned on th day of march in the year is hereby reconvened opening of new scottish parliament building construction of the scottish parliament building began in june and the first debate in the new building was held on tuesday september the formal opening by the queen took place on october enric miralles the spanish architect who designed the building died before its completion from until the opening of the new building in committee rooms and the debating chamber of the scottish parliament were housed in the general assembly hall of the church of scotland located on the mound in edinburgh office and administrative accommodation in support of the parliament were provided in buildings leased from the city of edinburgh council the new scottish parliament building brought together these different elements into one purpose built parliamentary complex housing msps and more than staff and civil servants the building aims to conceive poetic union between the scottish landscape its people its culture and the city of edinburgh an approach that won the parliament building numerous awards including the stirling prize and it has been described as tour de force of arts and crafts and quality without parallel in the last years of british architecture powers over scottish railways transferred as result of provisions in the railways bill powers were transferred from the department of transport to the scottish executive move described by then first minister jack mcconnell as the most significant devolution of new powers to scottish ministers since scottish executive becomes scottish government scottish executive was created under section of the scotland act following the scottish parliament election the scottish executive was rebranded as the scottish government by the new scottish national party administration other changes that took place at this time included the development of the national performance framework and major restructuring whereby directors general were put in charge of the achievement of the government strategic objectives these changes have been described as developing form of strategic state the new name use in westminster legislation was updated by scotland act calman commission the calman commission was established by motion passed by the scottish parliament on december its terms of reference are to review the provisions of the scotland act in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the scottish parliament to better serve the people of scotland that would improve the financial accountability of the scottish parliament and that would continue to secure the position of scotland within the united kingdom however concerns have been expressed that its final report will not have much legitimacy because it was skewed towards preserving the status quo powers transferred over planning and nature conservation matters at sea during agreement was reached to transfer responsibility for all planning and nature conservation matters at sea up to miles from the scottish coast to the scottish government the change has implications for the offshore industry wind and wave power and to lesser extent fishing though responsibility for fishing quotas remains european union issue and oil and gas licensing and permitting remains reserved matter independence referendum in august the snp announced referendum bill would be included in its package of bills to be debated before parliament in with the intention of holding referendum on the issues of scottish independence in november the bill did not pass due to the snp status as minority administration and due to the initial opposition to the bill from all other major parties in the scottish parliament following the scottish parliament election the snp had majority in parliament and again brought forward an independence referendum bill the scottish government also suggested that full fiscal autonomy for scotland known as devo max could be an alternative option in the vote the negotiation of the edinburgh agreement resulted in the uk government legislating to provide the scottish parliament with the powers to hold the referendum the devo max option was not included however as the edinburgh agreement stipulated that the referendum had to be clear binary choice between independence or the existing devolution arrangements the scottish independence referendum franchise act was passed by the scottish parliament and campaigning commenced two days before the referendum was held with polls very close the leaders of the three main uk political parties made the vow public pledge to devolve extensive new powers to the scottish parliament if independence was rejected they also agreed to devolution timetable proposed by gordon brown after heavy campaigning by both sides voting took place on september independence was rejected by margin of in favour to against smith commission the day after the referendum david cameron announced the formation of the smith commission to convene cross party talks concerning recommendations for further devolution of powers to the scottish parliament two months later on november the commission published its recommendations which included giving the scottish parliament complete power to set income tax rates and bands increased borrowing powers and an extensive list of other rights and powers scotland act based on the smith commission recommendations the scotland act was passed by parliament and received royal assent on march the act set out amendments to the scotland act and devolved further powers to scotland most notably the ability to amend sections of the scotland act which relate to the operation of the scottish parliament and the scottish government within the united kingdom including control of its electoral system subject to two thirds majority within the parliament for any proposed change legislative control over areas such as onshore oil and gas extraction rail franchising consumer advocacy and advice amongst others by devolution of powers in relation to these fields to the scottish parliament and the scottish ministers management of the crown estate and the british transport police in scotland control over certain and removable taxes including air passenger duty full control over scottish income tax including income tax rates and bands on non savings and non dividend income the act recognised the scottish parliament and scottish government as permanent among uk constitutional arrangements with referendum required

uniform after his enlistment period was up he returned to his home state to raise the first vermont cavalry serving with them until he had reached the rank of captain by that time and that summer he was appointed provost marshal and assigned to new york city where he would oversee enforcing conscription in the tenth district although criticized for the low number of recruits compared to the other provost marshals in the city secretary of war edwin stanton defended erhardt efforts stating the men he enlists may be few but they go to the front and fight every one of them they are not bounty jumpers in the days before the new york draft riots he was confronted by several men with iron bars while trying to collect names in new tenement building at broadway and liberty street erhardt held the men off for three hours while waiting for reinforcements armed only with his pistol but was eventually forced to retreat without the names mid life after the war erhardt became lawyer and remained in new york serving as assistant district attorney in brooklyn in erhardt was named as police commissioner of the new york police department by governor samuel tilden after the dismissal of george washington matsell and abram disbecker by mayor william wickham erhardt was strong advocate of introducing style of military discipline within the department he also criticized the substitution of one police commissioner as replacement for the old four man committee commenting that it was an absurdity to have removable commissioner at the head of an irremovable force however it was widely

determined honest generous and able not stain has been cast on his name not man can say word against him to impeach his qualifications for the mayoralty of new york one of seven candidates it was suggested at the time that erhardt had merely been placed on the ticket as political sacrifice for the republicans in spite of this he made strong showing in the race but was defeated by the tammany hall candidate hugh grant partly due to his popularity in the election erhardt was made collector of the port of new york shortly afterwards his appointment was only reluctantly made by thomas platt then leader of the republican party in new york and because of erhardt resistance against the city political machine he and his followers did everything within their power to interfere with and otherwise undermine erhardt he finally resigned in announcing that the collector has been reduced to position where he is no longer an independent officer with authority commensurate with his responsibility this was the last position he would ever hold later life he was successful businessman in his later years serving as the president and director of the public accountants corporation

aircraft crashed into maintenance vehicles on the runway killing people on board and on the ground while chain of mistakes in airport operations contributed to the accident its major cause was an air traffic controller falling asleep on duty this remains the deadliest aviation accident on russian territory it was also the deadliest aviation accident involving tupolev tu at the time until the crash of aeroflot flight months later as of it still ranks as the second deadliest accident involving tupolev tu accident details at am local time utc gmt hours flight was preparing to land at tsentralny airport in omsk key russian city in southwestern siberia which has population of over million and is the administrative center of omsk oblast at the time this was the only aircraft approaching omsk and it was cleared for landing when it contacted the airport at am worried that the continuing rain would make the runway overly slippery the airport ground maintenance crew requested permission to dry the runway the ground controller on duty gave permission and proceeded to fall asleep soon after in the process forgetting to switch on the runway occupied warning under airport regulations this procedure should never have happened permission to close and do maintenance on runway could only be given by the chief controller and he was absent the maintenance crew following the airport routine moved three vehicles to the runway uaz all terrain vehicle with an attached trailer operated by driver and crew manager in front followed by kraz and ural trucks the latter were equipped with dry air compressors and loaded with fuel and weighed tons the drying detail then proceeded to violate their own safety rules while performing their tasks all of their vehicles should have their top flickering lights on continuously however the lights were too bright for the maintenance workers liking so they kept them lit only until they started and after they finished their work this intentional oversight caused the pilots to be unable to see the vehicles on the runway from their position in contrast the runway crew saw the tu coming at them from good distance with its landing lights on they did attempt to contact ground control three times about the lights but received no response and so ignored them thinking they were being tested by plane not on final approach uaz around am flight requested permission to land from the approach controller the request was sent twice the pilots noticed vague contours on the runway and wanted to double check for obstacles the controller verified the runway status which remained apparently unoccupied then contacted the ground controller and received no response the approach controller subsequently contacted the flight controller on internal radio and received an inaudible reply reported to sound like bodna which was taken to mean svobodna meaning free communications were being taped and were analyzed later the approach controller cleared the landing though unable to see the runway and in spite of regulations that required him to keep the flight in the air and double check the runway status both the ground controller and secondary controller should have been able to see the runway but the former was asleep and the latter was absent due to staff shortages at am the flight passed the lowest height at which the flight crew could abort the landing the aircraft landed at normal on touchdown the flight crew saw the array of drying vehicles and attempted to turn the aircraft but were unable to avoid the collision the plane crashed into the ural truck and then down the runway crashed into the kraz igniting the tons of fuel in each truck and the aircraft fuel tank the plane overturned and broke into pieces some of which crashed into the uaz catastrophic fracture of the fuel tanks caused burning fuel to leak into the fuselage incinerating all but one passenger the cockpit section detached and flew past the burning vehicles it suffered no major damage and all four crew members survived suffering only minor injuries they escaped from the cabin and ran to the crash site in an attempt to help the passengers only one of the aircraft passengers survived four ground maintenance crew were killed instantly inside the vehicles one person in the passenger seat of the uaz caught on fire which was extinguished saving them investigation state investigation concluded that the accident was caused by chain of mistakes owing to the negligence of air traffic controllers as well as disobedience of basic airport maintenance and safety regulations the ground controller was found directly responsible as he fell asleep on the job and thus did not respond to emergency queries he also allowed the service trucks to move onto the runway and did not mark the runway as occupied at hearing he could not recollect his actions during the time in question but did not deny the charges he was sentenced to years and committed suicide in prison in addition the flight operations manager was sentenced to years in prison the approach controller to years and the head of airport maintenance to years all three appealed their sentences to no avail future inspections at numerous other soviet airports also found similar types and numbers of violations of safety regulations resulting in the firing of several high level officials thereafter no pilot error or aircraft deficiency was found the plane weight and balance were within its defined norms due to poor visibility the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway while they did have some reasonable doubts as to whether or not the runway was occupied these were allayed by the approach controller reassurances the crew had only few seconds to avoid the collision on the ground they took evasive action but could not possibly save the aircraft they were thus absolved of any blame the flight and approach controllers were experienced professionals with at least years of service the ground controller on duty who was years old was new he supposedly had not had enough sleep in the days before the accident having had to care for his two young children the formal hearing of the case occurred only three months after the accident due to the obvious set of circumstances most of that time was spent on identifying the victims and locating their relatives all of the accused as well as their attorneys received threats and were moved to the hearings under heavy security technical data and statistics the tupolev tu was operated by aeroflot later becoming east siberia it was equipped with three kuznetsov nk engines and first flew in the flight carried passengers including teenagers and young children kg lb of luggage kg lb of post and kg lb of cargo the flight had crew of the captain was highly experienced with hours in the air including hours of night flights the flight was approaching omsk in poor weather light rain visibility km miles with
